# Sentiment Analysis 

This project is a Sentiment Analysis project which is built in python and flask framework. Tensorflow and Keras were used to build the predictive model. The predictive model predicts whether a given text is positive, negative, or neutral. Kedro framework was used to build reproducible and concise code for the machine learning workflow. Flask was used to build the microservice to receive the request object from the frontend client.

## ðŸš€ About Us
We are a team of four who contributed to the development of this project. We work as software 
emgineers at turntabl Ghana. With the help of our engineering team leads Calvin and Simona we were able to complete this project.

## Used By

This project is used by the following department at Turntabl Ghana:

- Turntabl TTlabs

## Lessons Learned
We learnt how to use kedro framework since it was our first time working with kedro. Kedro is 
an open source framework made by quantum black to help data scientist produce reproducible and concise code
